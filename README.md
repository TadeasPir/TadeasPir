# Hello there welcome to my repo. ðŸš€

## About
This repository is a playground for my adventures in web development, game development, and 3D modelling. With a focus on .NET, and JavaScript, and now venturing into PHP, I'm passionate about exploring the realms of both web technologies and game design.

## Game Development ðŸŽ®
Dive into the world of game development mainly in Unity. Currently working on my first full-fledged game.

## Web Development ðŸ’»
Explore cutting-edge web technologies and frameworks such as Bootstrap, or React. Currently diving into server-side scripting with PHP.

I'm focusing on Blender and exploring 3D as a whole.
